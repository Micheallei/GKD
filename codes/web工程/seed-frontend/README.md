### Rust DFS login/out 模块说明

从 seed realworld example 改写。

* 运行：在目录下先 `cargo make watch` 生成 /pkg 和 /target 目录，再 `cargo make serve` ，在 localhost:8000 访问。
* cargo check 有输出一些函数从未使用、 use 的模块从未使用等等 warning，应该可以再删一些内容。
* 目前账号是与 RealWorld 内相同的，还不知道怎么修改。

# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Seed codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://realworld.seed-rs.org/) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Seed** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Seed** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

_NOTE:_ This project uses older Seed version `0.5.1`. It will be updated and refactored once [Seeder](https://github.com/MartinKavik/seeder) is ready. Please see [built-in examples](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed/blob/master/examples/README.md) and other projects instead.

# How it works

I think the best way to show you how it works is to describe what's going on step by step when you open this example in your browser. So let's say you've just written `https://seed-rs-realworld.netlify.com/` to URL bar and pressed Enter:

1. Netlify redirects your request to `index.html`. (See `/netlify.toml`.)
1. There is a script in `/index.html` that loads `wasm` file and starts application.
1. Application is initialized in `/src/lib.rs` - see block `Start` at the end of that file.
1. The first is called function `before_mount` (we are still in file `lib.rs`):
   1. You can select mount point with `.mount_point("element-id")`. But the default one (`app`) is good for us.
   1. `.mount_type(MountType::Takeover)` means that the previous HTML content in the mount point will be replaced with the application HTML.
1. Then the function `after_mount` is called:
   1. It tries to load `Viewer` from the local storage. `Viewer` is the object that contains info about currently logged in user (name, auth. token, avatar image url, etc).
   1. Then it creates a new `Session` with `Viewer` (or without it if you are not logged in). `Session` is de facto shared state - you are able to get it from all pages.
   1. Then the `Model` is created with `Session`. `Model` is enum, where each variant represents one page. Here, in `init` function, we create `Model` from variant `Redirect` because we haven't decided yet which page to show (i.e. `Redirect` is a "placeholder" variant).
   1. And we also try to parse given URL and send result to Seed's runtime.
1. `after_mount` function also sends message `RouteChanged` which is handled in `update` function. Handler calls function `change_model_by_route` which choose the right `Model` according to the URL path.
1. `Model::Home` is chosen in our example. However this variant should contain "sub-model" from `/src/page/home` so we need to call `page::home::init(..)` to get it.
1. `page::home::init` loads required data (e.g. article feed or tags).
1. We have data to show so when Seed's runtime calls `View` function again we can see it rendered in the browser.

We didn't talked about function `sink` in `lib.rs` in the steps above. `sink` has the similar purpose like `update` function but it handles global messages. It's the way how modules communicate with parents or with other modules. The most use case is to send `GMsg::RoutePushed` when we want to go to another page (see function `go_to` in `/src/route.rs`).

# Getting started

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Update Rust: `$ rustup update`
3. Install WASM target: `$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
4. Install [cargo-make](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/): `$ cargo install --force cargo-make`
5. Build project from its root: `$ cargo make all` or `$ cargo make watch`
   - _Note:_ You need some dependencies like `pkg-config` on Linux - just follow recommendations after compilation errors.
6. Start local server: `$ cargo make serve`
   - _Note:_ You have to open a new terminal tab/window if you used `$ cargo make watch`.
7. Open in you browser [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

# Contributing

1. Create issues and PRs - bugs, missing documentation, typos, unreadable code...
2. Squash commits, rebase on the current `master` and run `$ cargo make verify` (+ commit changes, if any) before creating PR.
